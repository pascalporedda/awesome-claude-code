3. **Hook Structure**:
   ```typescript
   // hooks/your-hook-name.ts
   import { promises as fs } from 'fs';
   import { join } from 'path';
   
   // Read JSON from stdin
   const input = await fs.readFile('/dev/stdin', 'utf8');
   const event = JSON.parse(input);
   
   // Process event
   // ... your hook logic
   
   // Exit with appropriate code
   process.exit(0);
   ```

4. **Testing**:
   - Test your hook locally with sample data
   - Verify it works across different platforms
   - Include test cases if applicable

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update README.md with hook description
   - Document configuration options
   - Include troubleshooting tips
